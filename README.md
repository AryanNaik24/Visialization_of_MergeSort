# Sorting Algorithm Visualization

## Overview
This project is a **real-time sorting algorithm visualizer** using **Python and Matplotlib**. It dynamically updates a bar graph to show how different sorting algorithms process an array step by step.

## Features
✅ **Visualizes sorting step-by-step** with bar heights representing array values.  
✅ **Supports multiple sorting algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort.  
✅ **Live updating animation** using Matplotlib's `FuncAnimation`.  
✅ **Customizable array size and sorting algorithm**.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed along with the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install matplotlib numpy
```
## Changing Sorting Algorithm
To switch between sorting algorithms,Write code for the required sorting algorithm and modify this line in `main.py`:
```python
sorting_algorithm = quick_sort  # Change to merge_sort, bubble_sort, etc.
```

## Example Output
A dynamic bar graph where bars change heights as the sorting algorithm progresses.
